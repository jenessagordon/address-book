# Address Book

This address book application is for users who wish to manage their contacts. 
It is unique from ordinary address books because it lets the user organize 
their contacts according to the relationship they have with each contact 
(i.e. whether the contact is a friend, family member, professional contact, 
or other.) The other, less original features that the user has access to are:
1. The ability to add one or multiple new contact(s) to the address book. Attributes for each 
contact that can be included are:
    - First name 
    - Last name 
    - Address 
    - Phone number 
    - Email
    - Birthday 
    - Date the contact is added 
    - Where the user met them

2. The ability to delete a contact from the address book
3. The ability to view a list of all the user's contacts

This project is of interest to me because I wish to explore how information can be organized in a program, how users 
can access and make changes to the information they have stored in a program, and how information can best be 
represented graphically. I anticipate that I will be able to learn the most about each of these concepts by choosing a 
project idea that is simple and easily modifiable. I have this expectation because choosing a simple project will 
enable me to focus more on the programming concepts that I am learning and less on the details of the various features I 
want to implement.
